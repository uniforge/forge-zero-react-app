        Uniforge recognizes that each and every NFT project is unique, but has
        also identified some common patterns across projects. Looking at Solsets
        pecifically, each token (Solset) is part of a collection (Solsets), and
        the total number of tokens has a maximum supply. Additionally, creating
        a token and subsequent trading may require payment to the original
        artist; in the case of Solsets, creation requires â—Ž0.25 and secondary
        trading is subject to a fee of 5%. All of these constraints are set when
        a new collection is created on-chain.

        From a cost perspective, we can batch these instructions to avoid paying

        account for every NFT and paying the requiste rent to keep that account

        For many projects, associating the NFT with an integer such as a u8 or
        u16 is sufficient. CryptoPunks for example has just 10,000 unique
        tokens, a number comfortably within the range of a u16. If <em>i</em> is
        the punk id, then punk <em>i</em> is simply the piece of content at
        index <em>i</em> within an array of content. To commit to a specific

      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        We adopted a similar approach for Solsets, and more broadly any project
        that fits this paradigm (note the content hash property on the Forge
        struct). Since there are only 8,192 unique Solsets, we represent each
        Solset by a u16. Additionally, each Solset can offered for sale, and if
        so, a minimum acceptable bid for the Solset can be specified. This leads
        to the following data structure for each token.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        Rather than keep a global map from Solset number to the owner's public
        key, as is done for ERC-721 but would prevent parallel execution in the
        Solana runtime, for each user we create an account which "holds" their
        tokens. The cost of this approach is roughly â—Ž0.000126 per token at the
        time of writing (3.5% of the cost of the usual NFT creation process
        using the token program). It is worth noting that both approaches offer
        very low fiat costs; $0.142 and $0.00503, respectively, assuming $40 per
        Sol. We simply sought to leverage the ERC-721 design pattern to further
        reduce creation costs.

      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        Arguably the most readily apparent limitation of this approach is the
        fixed number of tokens each account can hold. For Devnet Solsets, we
        chose a size of 32 tokens per account, but this is an arbitrary choice.
        Ultimately this affects the size of the upfornt cost of rent-exemption.
        There are many solutions that allow for owning more tokens such as
        paying for a larger account upfront, adding an attribute to the account
        layout which points to the "next" account, or creating associated
        accounts with deterministic seeds that increment.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title level={2}>Claiming a token and transfers</Title>
      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        Now that the basic data structures are laid out, we can cover how the
        program mutates state when tokens are claimed or transfered between
        accounts. When a new token is claimed, the program checks whether all of
        the tokens have already been claimed. If there are any unclaimed tokens,
        then the program creates a new token, adds it to the user's account, and
        pays the artist. If all tokens have been claimed then the program
        throws.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        Transfers or trades involve mutating the accounts of both the seller and
        buyer. When a seller marks a token as being offered for sale, this
        enables anyone to purchase the token by paying the minimum fee specified
        by the seller. When this happens, the program checks that the token is
        indeed owned and offered for sale by the seller, the program then checks
        that the buyer has room for the token in their account, lastly it checks
        that the fee being paid is sufficient given the seller's asking price.
        If all these criteria are met, then the trade is able to occur.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title level={2}>Events</Title>
      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        There are three events emitted by the program,
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        <ol>
          <li>
            ForgeEvent - This event occurs whenever a new token is claimed
          </li>
          <li>
            OfferEvent - This event occurs whenever a token is offered for sale
          </li>
          <li>
            TransferEvent - This event occurs whenever a token is transferred
            between users
          </li>
        </ol>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="tech-text">
        Anyone can subscribe to the program's logs, parse these events, and
        define their own logic that is triggered as a result. The specific
        structures are presented below and can be unpacked from the logs in a
        similar manner as was done above.
